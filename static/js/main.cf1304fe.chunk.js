The problem with this aproach is that in practice it's not working because of the large number of particles. You need other assumptions and methodes to successfully handle this problem. The assumptions, what you need to take, could not be justified mathematically until now, only the success of the theory justify them. The theory accurately describes the experiments. There is a more serious concern against this theory. We call it the reversibility paradox. The laws of physics are symmetric for the time reversion. It means that every natural process should be able to go backwards in time according to the laws of physics. So if you film a natural process and play the film backwards, the process what you see, should not be against the laws of physics. If the film shows a process in a system, which contains a huge amount of particles, you never experience the reversed process in nature, which you can see on the film played backwards.
