You need\n            to know calculus of one and multi variable functions to start\n            learning from these books. It is also beneficial to watch\n            experimental physics lessons at least online like\n            <a\n              className=\"pl-1\"\n              href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEHVhv0SBMpP75JbzJShqw\"\n            >\n              Walter Lewin's lectures\n            </a>\n            .\n          </p>\n          <h2>Mathematical Methodes in the Physiscal Sciences</h2>\n          <p>\n            This is the classic book, which explains everything on as elementary\n            way as possible. It contains lots of problems to provide you all the\n            experience with the math you need to study physics as an\n            undergraduate. You need to solve these problems to absorb the\n            material. This is true for the other books too. There is no shortcut\n            here even if you feel the amount of practice overwhelming. You will\n            just need all this math to cope with the rest.\n          </p>\n          <h2>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</h2>\n          <p>\n            This is a beautifully written book, which is very entertaining read.\n            This book is far from popscience, although it's as friendly as\n            possible on the math.Feynman uses the bear minimum math to explain\n            whatever he wants to tell you about physics, and he has a lot to\n            tell you. The book is full of Feynman's own way to explain things,\n            so you won't always get the typical explanation. The way how Feynman\n            explains sometimes very difficult things looks very simple and\n            understandable. But don't be a fool. Don't think this book will make\n            you a person like Feynman even if you had the capabilities. The book\n            only shows you how Feynman was able to understand physics after\n            wondering about it a lot. He also must have solved a lot of\n            problems, much more than he has in this book. This book is the one,\n            which you will love the most and entertains you instead of teaching.\n            This is the best possible motivation you can get. You will need\n            every drop of that for the rest of the books, because those will\n            teach you.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-2 mt-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\n          <img\n            className=\"m-2\"\n            src=\"./images/classicalmechanics.jpeg\"\n            alt=\"the Earth and the Moon in space\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-6\">\n          <h2>Classical Mechanics</h2>\n          <p>\n            Taylor's book is a pedagogical masterpiece. It will introduce you\n            Classical mechanics on the way you should know it for your future\n            studies. It won't teach you too much just what you absolutely need,\n            but it does a brilliant job. The book is long and verbose and it\n            contains a lot of problems to solve. These are almost always very\n            doable and useful. It even gives you enough computer problems to\n            learn basic computer programming for scientific applications. You\n            shouldn't miss this opportunity. The verbosity in this case comes\n            with very high level of clarity. This book will teach you classical\n            mechanics even if you are a weaker student, who is willing to learn\n            like me. We must admit the process can be overwhelming, but Taylor\n            not only teaches you classical mechanics. He also makes you practice\n            your math on a basic level, and he knows what you will need for your\n            further studies. The read is not difficult, but it is not\n            entertaining too much. Everything is very clearly explained from\n            more dirrections usually. The explanations are the standard ones,\n            Taylor is not like Feynman. The book is extremly useful and a bit\n            boring, especially compared to Feynman's book.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-2 mt-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\n          <img\n            className=\"m-2\"\n            src=\"./images/electrodynamics.jpeg\"\n            alt=\"electrical discharge on the coil of a Tesla-transformer\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-6\">\n          <h3>Introduction to Electrodynamics</h3>\n          <p>\n            This book is to electrodynamics than Taylor is to classical\n            mechanics. The subject is mature and not very entertaining on this\n            level, but Griffiths style makes it as enjoyable as possible. He has\n            even fine humour, which can make you laugh at some points. Don't be\n            misled. This book doesn't want to entertain you. This will take your\n            hand and teach you how to do electrodynamics. The material is very\n            conventional. The book also make you practice the necessary math. It\n            is not enough to read it. You have to do the problems too. These are\n            doable problems.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-2 mt-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\n          <img\n            className=\"m-2\"\n            src=\"./images/quantum.jpeg\"\n            alt=\"quantum corral made by STM\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-6\">\n          <h3>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</h3>\n          <p>\n            The laws of nature on the atomic level are not the laws of classical\n            mechanics, but quantum mechanics. These are pretty\n            counter-intuitive. All of our intuition comes from macroscopic\n            experience and we luck of any intuition on the atomic level. The\n            math is fairly simple, which is a surprise. This book is the most\n            readable account of the subject on undergraduate level. This will\n            teach you the math and how to do quantum mechanics. The book doesn't\n            have anything about the hystory of the subject or the experimental\n            facts, which led to quantum mechanics. It won't force the Dirac\n            bra-ket notation, it simply teaches you how to apply the Schrodinger\n            equation. We call this aproach wave mechanics, this is how QM is\n            still applied today in theoretical chemistry, but not the full\n            story. The book on the other hand won't hide away the philosophical\n            difficulties of the interpretation of the math.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-2 mt-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\n          <img\n            className=\"m-2\"\n            src=\"./images/particle.jpeg\"\n            alt=\"inside the tunnel of LHC\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-6\">\n          <h3>Introduction to Elementary Particles</h3>\n          <p>\n            If you are interested in the laws of quantum mechanics on the\n            subatomic level this is the best introductory book to read. You will\n            need the material from Griffiths QM book to understand this book.It\n            will teach you Feynman-diagrams but it's not a quantum field theory\n            book, so don't expect it to reveal how the Feynman-rules come out\n            from basic principles. It's really just an introduction instead of\n            the full story.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Student Friendly Quantum Field Theory</h3>\n          <p>\n            I can say this is the only book, which can be recommended to you on\n            the undergraduate level to study quantum field theory. The book will\n            teach you this, but only deals with the theory of the\n            electromagnetic interaction. This is called quantum electrodynamics.\n            The subject is notoriously difficult and it's typically tought on\n            graduate level. We can say it's 5 year postgraduate study to learn\n            this. This book is obviously can not be the final word, but it is\n            the best place to start your studies. The calculations are detailed\n            and as a bonus the solution book is available to the problems in the\n            book. It's great for self study.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-2 mt-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\n          <img\n            className=\"m-2\"\n            src=\"./images/thermodynamics.webp\"\n            alt=\"match is getting flamed\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-6\">\n          <h3>Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics</h3>\n          <p>\n            This is the book to learn how the laws of classical and quantum\n            mechanics can be applied to systems, which contain a huge number of\n            particles. In theory if you knew the state of all the particles now\n            you could callculate the state of the system in any later time\n            according to the laws of quantum mechanics. The problem with this\n            aproach is that in practice it's not working because of the large\n            number of particles. You need other assumptions and methodes to\n            successfully handle this problem. The assumptions, what you need to\n            take, could not be justified mathematically until now, only the\n            success of the theory justify them. The theory accurately describes\n            the experiments. There is a more serious concern against this\n            theory. We call it the reversibility paradox. The laws of physics\n            are symmetric for the time reversion. It means that every natural\n            process should be able to go backwards in time according to the laws\n            of physics. So if you film a natural process and play the film\n            backwards, the process what you see, should not be against the laws\n            of physics. If the film shows a process in a system, which contains\n            a huge amount of particles, you never experience the reversed\n            process in nature, which you can see on the film played backwards.\n            Why is this, if this reversed process is not against the laws of\n            physics?\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-2 mt-5\"></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-4\">\n          <img\n            className=\"m-2\"\n            src=\"./images/blackhole.webp\"\n            alt=\"black hole visualisations\"\n            width=\"100%\"\n          />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"col-6\">\n          <h3>Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology</h3>\n          <p>\n            Quantum mechanics is difficult, because our intuition is far from\n            the atomic world.

The differential geometry, which has been used by Einstein\n            to express the theory is difficult to learn, so this theory is\n            hardly ever thought on the undergraduate level.
